## Drown Out Distractions

There's this site I really like to use for drowning out noise called [asoftmurmur](https://asoftmurmur.com). I've been using it for years but I noticed a couple of things recently that caused some alarm.

1. **It hasn't been updated in over 6 years.** Anyone who develops software knows that a project is either being actively maintained or is dead. Just about all projects rely on 3rd party dependencies and security needs change over time. Projects must be maintained to remain compatible and secure. It may take a while for the code to rot away completely but it will happen; all while leaving the users more and more vulnerable as time passes. From what I can tell the app is written in React which will have 3rd party dependencies, all of which need to be updated regularly. This leads me to my next point -

2. **It's closed source.** This means I have no idea what's actually happening within the app while I'm using it. I'm sure the creator of the app has nothing but good intentions but experience has taught me to trust open source above anything closed. Open source code is inherently more trustworthy and in many cases more secure. Plus it has the added benefit of being forkable so if I get hit by a bus or I don't touch it for years someone else can pick up the torch.

I only use one sound mix so I made a version of that and that's what's deployed to https://focusfuzz.com. The app is just a big play/stop button. Good enough.
